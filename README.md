# ITEM BUCKET

A todo list with "Today" concept.  
There are 2 lists of tasks, the "General" and "Today" lists.  
The idea is to accumulate tasks in "General" but only move tasks to "Today" if you are thinking on tackling those tasks today. If for some reason the day ends and there are unfinished tasks you can clear "Today" list and re make it with the tasks you need. 

This accomodates the workflow when multiple new tasks arrive of higher priority than the ones previously added to today's list and help to reduce the focus needed to pick the next task to work on.
