# ITEM BUCKET

A to-do list with a "Today" concept.  
There are two lists of tasks. The "General" and "Today" lists.  
The idea is to accumulate tasks in "General" but only move tasks to "Today" if you are thinking of tackling those tasks today. If for some reason, the day ends and there are unfinished tasks, 
you can clear the list "Today" and re make it with the tasks you need from "General". 

This accommodates the workflow of multiple new tasks being bombarded at you and you need to adjust priority on your current tasks to avoid loosing your mind and also to avoid tasks slipping through the cracks.
